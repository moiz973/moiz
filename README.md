Hello, my name is Moiz Madan Khan, I’m from Pakistan and I live in hyderabad. I’m a student at a university , and it was thinking about our university mail so I came up with the idea of making CS50 mail website for the final CS50 project.

My final project is used to register an account, log in, send mails and receive mails and reply.

I was really fascinated with how mails work so i had idea from beginning for final project to make CS50 mail.

My project CS50 mail was developed with a focus on sender and recipient where they could send mails and talk to each other and i also used some code from finance pset.

All information about users, inbox and password for each people are stored in project.db.

## Tables used in the project

*first Table Emails*
Where i put id, sender, recipient, subject body and timestamp. notice that id must be a primary key here.

*2nd Table users*
id, username and hash(password).also id will be primary key here.

## Technologies used

The site was built using Flask (Python), SQLite3 for the database, CSS, HTML and javascript. I built html files for compose, reply and inbox. And modified app.py files from finance. And  added new tables to database. Used hash for passwords.


## Conclusion

It was very interesting to create this project using Flask and I used a lot of new resources for me, which I had never worked with before. I spent a lot of time studying and testing before implementing the code.

I learned a lot from this project, and I was very happy with the result.
